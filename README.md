# Next.js 15 useRouter Hook Issue in Dynamic Routes

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the `useRouter` hook in Next.js 15 within dynamic routes.  The navigation using `router.push` doesn't behave predictably, often leading to incorrect page transitions or infinite redirects.

## Bug Description

The problem occurs specifically when navigating between pages that are dynamically generated or utilize dynamic routes. Using `router.push` does not always update the page as expected, leading to inconsistent behavior and potential infinite redirect loops.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Navigate to `/about`.
5. Click the button to go back to the home page.

Observe that the navigation might not work correctly, demonstrating the described behavior.

## Possible Causes

Potential causes might include:
* Issues with how Next.js 15 handles dynamic route navigation, specifically in combination with `useRouter`.
* Asynchronous operation conflicts within the navigation process.
* Unhandled edge cases related to client-side routing.

## Solution

See the solution branch for a possible fix using `router.replace` instead of `router.push`.  This approach has shown to improve the navigation reliability in this specific case.
